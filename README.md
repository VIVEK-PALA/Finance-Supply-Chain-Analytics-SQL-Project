# Finance-Supply-Chain-Analytics-SQL-Project
📊 A complete SQL capstone project built during the 
🔍 Business Case: AtliQ Hardware 

##  Objective

AtliQ Hardware struggled with Excel-based analysis across departments.  
This project solves that by migrating all business analysis into **MySQL**, enabling faster, dynamic, and scalable insights.

## Tools Used

-MySQL – For querying and transforming data.

-Excel – For basic preprocessing and data visualization

🔹 Reusable SQL Components

Stored Procedures and User-Defined Functions to encapsulate business logic

🔹 Forecasting Techniques

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and TEMP TABLES for demand trend and error analysis

🔹 Window Functions for Advanced Analysis

Applied ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK() using the OVER() clause to segment customers, rank product performance, and identify trends over time

🔹 Data Transformation & Integrity

Imported .CSV files, validated schemas, and enforced data constraints to maintain clean and reliable datasets
