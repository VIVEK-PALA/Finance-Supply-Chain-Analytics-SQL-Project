# Finance-Supply-Chain-Analytics-SQL-Project
📊 A complete SQL capstone project built during the 
🔍 Business Case: AtliQ Hardware 

## 🔥 Objective

AtliQ Hardware struggled with Excel-based analysis across departments.  
This project solves that by migrating all business analysis into **MySQL**, enabling faster, dynamic, and scalable insights.

## Tools Used

-MySQL – For querying and transforming data.

-Excel – For basic preprocessing and data visualization

## 📌 Key Business Insights

- ✅ Monthly & product-wise sales trends
- 📈 Top-performing markets and customers
- 🔁 Forecast accuracy across products and regions
- 📦 Supply chain error reporting using CTEs and TEMP tables
- 🔄 Reusable SQL procedures for stakeholder queries

## 📘 Topics I Mastered 
🔹 Data Retrieval & Filtering
Used SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses to extract and aggregate meaningful metrics from large datasets with precision.

🔹 Joins & Multi-Table Queries
Applied various joins such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN to merge fact and dimension tables for comprehensive analysis across customers, products, and time.

🔹 Stored Procedures & UDFs
Built dynamic and reusable Stored Procedures and User Defined Functions (UDFs) to simplify reporting tasks and enhance query reusability and performance.

🔹 Business Logic & Conditional Fields
Implemented CASE, IF, and calculated fields to derive business-specific metrics like profit margins, fiscal year alignment, customer segmentation, etc.

🔹 Forecasting with CTEs & Temporary Tables
Used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and TEMPORARY TABLES to calculate forecast error, accuracy percentage, and absolute deviation — critical for supply chain analytics.


🔹 Data Import & Transformation
Performed bulk .CSV imports and used appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, etc.) and constraints to align with clean database design principles.

## 💡 What I Learned
SQL is more than a query language — it’s a tool to solve business problems through logic and structure.

Readable and modular SQL increases the clarity, reusability, and performance of analytics pipelines.

Understanding business context is as important as writing technically correct queries — data alone doesn't solve problems; insights do.
